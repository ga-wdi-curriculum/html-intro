## Quiz Questions

- Which of the following is the best way to center the text in div?
    - `<div><center></center></div>`
    - `<div align="center"></div>`
    - `<style>div{ text-align:center; }</style>`
    - `<div style="text-align:center;"></div>`
- Why do we write `<img />` and not `<img></img>`?
- Why is it important to keep semantics (HTML) separate from style (CSS)?

## Homework
<div style="text-align:center;"></div> {the best of the options but inline styling is not recommended - it will also override and internal or external styling}

the img tag is a self closing tag that does not need a closing tag

so you can easily navigate your code;  putting it all on 1 document it becomes too long and unmanageable
